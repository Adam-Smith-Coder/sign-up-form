# sign-up-form

The goal of this project is to create a sign up form in HTML to match up to the design goal image (saved in the design-goal folder) from The Odin Project Sign-up Form task.

This is the first time I will have had to use 'Form' properties so this will be good practice for that as well as further UX and design practice.
